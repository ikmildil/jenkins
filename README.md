# Exploring Jenkins: Deploying Automation with Docker on CentOS, Unveiling CI/CD Capabilities, Cloud Integration and Much More

###  _Please be aware that the steps or keywords Iâ€™ve used might change in the future, as Jenkins continually updates the layout of their web interface._

In this Jenkins series, we will delve into deploying Jenkins using Docker on a CentOS host, delving into Docker concepts. Prior knowledge of Docker is assumed. Following deployment, we will explore multiple essential plugins integral to Jenkins functionality. Demonstrating various job execution methods, including manual and automated triggering via cronjobs, we will also delve into Jenkins' node capabilities. This includes adding permanent agents of different types and configuring cloud environments such as EC2 and Docker.

Furthermore, we will highlight Jenkins' significant CI/CD capabilities by incorporating Ruby code. Additionally, we will explore Jenkins' integration with AWS, specifically utilizing S3 storage. I recommend starting from Part 1 and progressing sequentially unless you are already familiar with Jenkins. These lab exercises aim to provide valuable insights and a smoother learning journey than my own experiences. Sharing this knowledge is motivated by the desire to spare others the challenges I faced and facilitate a more seamless learning path for you.
